Please note: discounts and conditions vary at each hotel. The city of Porto also charges a tourist tax on every booking, (Porto Tourist Tax). The fee is 2 € per person / night in all tourist resorts and local accommodation, up to a maximum of 7 consecutive nights per person / stay, regardless of the type of booking (face-to-face, analog or digital). It is not subject to VAT according to  article nº2 section 2 of the Value Added Tax Code (that  tax is no longer payable from the 7th night). In all of the hotel deals below, the discount applies only to the regular booking rate. This means you will have to pay the full amount of the Porto Tourist Tax on top of your room rate .
